This project involved an in-depth analysis of the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2018 dataset to evaluate global educational outcomes, with a specific focus on Greece. By integrating socio-economic factors such as parental education and GDP per capita from the World Economic Outlook Database, the study explored the impact on student performance in math, reading, and science. The project also examined gender disparities in educational outcomes and provided a comparative analysis of Greece's performance relative to other countries. Advanced data visualization techniques, including maps, boxplots, and density plots, were employed to present the findings effectively.

Skills Gained:

Data Analysis and Interpretation: Expertise in analyzing large-scale educational datasets (PISA 2018) to extract meaningful insights on global educational performance.
Data Visualization: Proficiency in creating complex visualizations such as maps, boxplots, density plots, and heatmaps using R (ggplot2, patchwork, GGally).
Statistical Analysis: Ability to perform statistical comparisons and correlation analysis to understand relationships between variables such as parental education, GDP per capita, and student performance.
R Programming: Advanced skills in R programming, including data cleaning, transformation, and the application of various libraries for data analysis and visualization.
Comparative International Analysis: Competence in conducting comparative analyses across different countries and regions, with a focus on educational outcomes.
Gender Disparity Analysis: Experience in analyzing and interpreting gender-based differences in educational performance globally.
